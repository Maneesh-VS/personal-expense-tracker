# personal-expense-tracker
Expense Tracker Web Application is an easy-to-do project based on Flask (Python), MySQL that allows the user to add the expenses, review and manage the daily expenses using a neat web interface. Flask serves the backend and verifies the HTTP request, the form submission and takes database query, and MySQL is used to plot the expense details like amount, category and date and the notes. An expanse_db database with an expenses table is created, as well as a file app.py of Flask server (layout of expenses viewing and inserting features), and a `home.html` layout with Bootstrap to style it. Expense details may be entered by the user in an HTML form which becomes a part of the MySQL database and a dynamic table. In order to run the project, it is necessary to install Flask and mysql dependencies, create the database, and starting the server with the command `python app.py` that is available on the address: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The project may be expanded to have other functions such as user authentication, expense filter, graphical report, and this makes it an excellent basic IT project to be used in demonstrations during placements.
